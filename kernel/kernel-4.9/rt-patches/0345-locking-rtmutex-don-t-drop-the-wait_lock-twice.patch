Subject: [PATCH 345/352] locking/rtmutex: don't drop the wait_lock twice

Since the futex rework, __rt_mutex_start_proxy_lock() does no longer
acquire the wait_lock so it must not drop it. Otherwise the lock is not
only unlocked twice but also the preemption counter is underflown.

It is okay to remove that line because this function does not disable
interrupts nor does it acquire the ->wait_lock. The caller does this so it is
wrong do it here (after the futex rework).
